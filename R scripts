SCRIPT-1 : This script performs a comprehensive TCGA-Data RNA-Seq analysis. It downloads and normalizes data, identifies differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal tissues using limma, and validates findings with machine learning. An Elastic Net classifier is trained for sample classification, and results are visualized through PCA, heatmaps, and functional enrichment analysis of gene clusters.
