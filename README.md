# 🧬 A comprehensive bioinformatics workflow for identifying and validating hub genes across multiple cancer types using TCGA data.
Cancer remains a leading cause of global mortality, with breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers among the most prevalent. Despite their distinct clinical and molecular features, this study aimed to identify conserved molecular signatures across these four selected cancer types (SCTs) to uncover potential pan-cancer diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets. Transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were systematically analyzed using a rigorous bioinformatic workflow, as outlined below.

*Comprehensive analysis workflow*

## 📋 Overview

This pipeline integrates multi-omics data analysis, machine learning, and network biology to identify robust cancer potential biomarkers with clinical relevance across major cancers, including breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers.

## 🔄 Workflow Steps

### 1. 📊 Data Acquisition & Pre-processing
- **Data Sources**: TCGA datasets (BRCA, LUAD, COAD, PRAD)
- **Sample Types**: 'Primary Tumor' and 'Solid Tissue Normal'
- **Tools**: `TCGAbiolinks` R package
- **Pre-processing**: Read Count normalization using `calcNormFactors()`, `model.matrix()`

### 2. 🔍 Differential Expression Analysis
- **Methods**: `lmFit()` and `eBayes()` from limma package
- **Thresholds**: 
  - `|logFC| > 1.5`
  - `padj < 0.05`
- **Output**: Identification of significantly differentially expressed genes

### 3. 🎯 Multi-Method key Gene Identification
| Method | Approach | Key Features |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **DEG Analysis** | Limma-based | Traditional differential expression |
| **WGCNA** | Co-expression networks | TOM, MEs, module membership |
| **Machine Learning** | ElasticNet pipeline | Feature selection with `glmnet` and `caret` |

### 4. 🌐 Network Analysis & Functional Enrichment
- **PPI Construction**: Integrated entries from BioGrid and HINT databases to create a comprehensive dataset of documented human-human (Homo sapiens) PPIs.
- **Clustering**: The Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL) --> (degree cut-off ≥ 3, inflation parameter ≥ 2)
- **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) Common DEGs**: 
  - `gsePathway()' function from the clusterProfiler package in R
  - pvalueCutoff < 0.05, minGSSize = 2, and maxGSSize = 500.
- **Functional enrichment analysis of clusters highlighted several significantly overrepresented pathways**: 
  - MSigDB, KEGG, EPC, Reactome databases: We integrate all databases for pathway analysis to ensure comprehensive coverage.
  -  pvalueCutoff < 0.05

### 5. ✅ Hub Gene Validation
- **Expression Level**: TNMPlot validation: It includes 56,938 unique samples from various sources, with 15,648 normal, 40,442 tumors, and 848 metastatic tumor samples. This large cohort provides a comprehensive view of gene expression in normal and cancer tissues (https://tnmplot.com/analysis/). 
- **Protein Level**: UALCAN database (UALCAN is a comprehensive, user-friendly, and interactive web resource for analyzing cancer OMICS data --> https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/)
- **Diagnostic Power**: ROC analysis with TCGAplot
- **Pan-Cancer**: Consistency across 33 TCGA cancer types

### 6. 🏥 Clinical & Immunological Analysis
- **Survival Analysis**: Cox Proportional Hazards Model (GEPIA3.0 for overall and progression-free survival)
- **Comprehensive pipeline for survival analysis**: using Cox proportional hazards models, integrating both clinical variables and gene expression data
    - survival + rms → Core Cox modeling & validation.
    - survminer + forestmodel + ggplot2 + ggpubr → Visualization (KM curves, forest plots, HR plots).
- **Immune Profiling**: 
  - Immune-correlation analysis (including immune checkpoint genes (ICGs), chemokines, chemokine receptors, immune stimulators, and immune inhibitors)
  - Immune-checkpoint inhibitors response (PD-1; PD-L1; CTLA-4)
